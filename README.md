# Smart City Database Design
- The Smart City is a centralized system supporting multiple urban services—such as transportation, education, banking, healthcare, and entertainment—through integrated, shared data.
- It ensures efficient, consistent access to services for citizens, while providing service-specific tools for providers.
- Common data like citizen info, payments, and locations are shared across services to create a seamless and connected city experience.
